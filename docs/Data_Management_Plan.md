# Data Management Plan
## 1. Data Description
We will collect regulatory toxicity value information from chemicals on the Superfund priority list to conduct probabilistic risk assessments. The data will include the following: 
- Points of departure (PODs)
- POD testing species
- Critical effects
- Inter- and intraspecies uncertainty factors
- Regulatory toxicity values

## 2. Data Collection
Relevant data will be sourced from the U.S. EPA Regional Screening Level database.

## 3. Data Storage and Backup
Data and associated dose-response will be stored in a dedicated directory on our secure research server. Data will be backed up daily and retained for a minimum of 6 months.

## 4. Data Organization and Documentation
Data will be meticulously documented and organized according to the reference sources. 

## 5. Data Preservation and Long-Term Access
Upon project completion, the dataset will be deposited in a recognized data repository to ensure long-term preservation and discoverability. The repository will assign a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for reliable referencing. 

## 6. Data Sharing and Access
After a brief embargo period to allow for primary analysis, the dataset will be openly accessible through the repository under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license, promoting data reuse with proper attribution.

## 7. Data Ethics and Legal Compliance
All data collection follows ethical guidelines.

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities
The author will oversee data management, ensuring accuracy and quality.

## 9. Budget and Resources
This Data Management Plan ensures responsible collection, storage, and sharing of risk assessment data.
